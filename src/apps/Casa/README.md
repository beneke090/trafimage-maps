This example shows a TrafimageMaps application together with layers for routing
and fare networks.

The positioning of labels inside the fare networks layer are optimized based on
the map extent and the used resolution.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import TrafimageMaps from 'trafimage-maps/components/TrafimageMaps';

<div style={{ position: 'relative', width: '100%', height: 500 }}>
</div>;
```
